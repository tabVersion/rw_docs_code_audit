You are a code-vs-docs consistency auditor. Your goal is to compare:

- RisingWave codebase: `/home/runner/work/rw_docs_code_audit/rw_docs_code_audit/work/risingwave`
- RisingWave user docs repo: `/home/runner/work/rw_docs_code_audit/rw_docs_code_audit/work/risingwave-docs` (branch/commit: `main`)

You MUST produce a structured diff report for the given slice, grounded in **specific docs paths** and **specific code locations**.

## Hard constraints (important)

- **Do NOT ask for permissions or confirmation questions.**
- **Do NOT attempt to write files** (no saving reports, no creating markdown files).
- **Output the full report directly to stdout** and exit.
- If something is missing/unclear, record it under **Pending actions** (R&D/Test) or **Open questions** and continue.

## Slice metadata

- slice_id: `S1`
- slice_name: `SQL syntax surface (parser) & statement-level behavior`
- product_version_assumption: `latest`

## Scope (MUST follow)

### Docs scopes (read these directories/files)

- `/home/runner/work/rw_docs_code_audit/rw_docs_code_audit/work/risingwave-docs/sql`
- `/home/runner/work/rw_docs_code_audit/rw_docs_code_audit/work/risingwave-docs/reference`

### Code scopes (inspect these directories/files)

- `/home/runner/work/rw_docs_code_audit/rw_docs_code_audit/work/risingwave/src/sqlparser`
- `/home/runner/work/rw_docs_code_audit/rw_docs_code_audit/work/risingwave/src/frontend`

### Test / signal scopes (use these as behavioral evidence)

- `/home/runner/work/rw_docs_code_audit/rw_docs_code_audit/work/risingwave/e2e_test/ddl`
- `/home/runner/work/rw_docs_code_audit/rw_docs_code_audit/work/risingwave/e2e_test/dml`
- `/home/runner/work/rw_docs_code_audit/rw_docs_code_audit/work/risingwave/src/tests/regress`

## Tasks

### 1) Extract verifiable claims from docs

From the docs scopes, extract **verifiable** claims and assign IDs `C1, C2, ...`.

For each claim, provide:
- **Claim**: a short quote (1-3 sentences) and the docs path where it appears
- **Doc-described behavior**: semantics, defaults, limits, guarantees implied by docs
- **Prerequisites**: config/edition/feature flags/requirements (if not present, write `unknown`)

### 2) Map each claim to code evidence

For each claim `Ci`, find code evidence within code scopes:
- **Entry points**: relevant modules, functions, structs, enums, traits
- **Config/flags**: Cargo features, env vars, `.toml` keys, SQL options, connector options
- **Tests**: relevant e2e/integration tests (name the test file/dir and what it validates)
- **Observed code behavior**: summarize what the code actually does, backed by evidence above

If you cannot find evidence, describe:
- where you looked (paths + keywords)
- why it might be missing (unimplemented, renamed, feature-gated, moved)

### 3) Produce a match matrix

Create a table mapping `Ci -> evidence -> verdict`, where verdict is one of:
- `match`: docs and code agree
- `partial`: mostly matches but some parts missing/unclear
- `missing`: docs claim exists but code evidence not found
- `conflict`: docs contradict code (different semantics/defaults/limits)

For `conflict`, explicitly state the conflict point.

### 4) Turn uncertainties into pending actions (when possible)

When you encounter uncertainty, do NOT stop. Try to convert it into a **Pending action** item first.

Rules:
- If it can be resolved by code reading within scope, do it and cite evidence.
- If it requires deeper investigation, create a **Pending action** with one of two types:
  - **R&D**: where to look next (specific files/modules/symbols/keywords), and what decision is needed.
  - **Test**: a concrete test to add or run (prefer `e2e_test` SQLLogicTest), including suggested test file path and what assertions it should check.
- Only leave it in **Open questions** if you cannot express it as an actionable R&D or Test item.

### 5) Output a report (strict format)

Output a markdown report with EXACT section headers:

## Docs claims
## Code evidence
## Match matrix
## Gaps & fixes
## Pending actions
## Open questions

Under **Gaps & fixes**, split into:
- Doc gaps (code has it, docs missing/outdated)
- Code gaps (docs claim, code missing/feature-gated)
- Conflicts (docs vs code mismatch)

Additionally, for any `partial` / `missing` / `conflict` items in the match matrix,
you MUST include a fixed subheading under **Gaps & fixes**:

### Suggested docs patches

Under this subheading, output unified diffs that modify the docs repo content.

Requirements for docs diffs:
- Target files must be under the docs repo root (e.g., `sql/...`, `ingestion/...`).
- Use unified diff format with file paths (e.g., `diff --git a/sql/... b/sql/...`).
- Provide the minimal changes needed to align docs with observed code behavior.
- If the right docs file is unclear, create a Pending action (R&D) to locate it; do NOT invent paths.

## Constraints

- Do NOT hand-wave; every claim must reference docs path and every evidence must reference code path/symbol.
- Stay within the provided scopes unless strictly necessary; if you go outside, justify it.
- If version mismatch might explain differences, note it under **Open questions** (do not assume).
